# Housing Price Prediction

## Project Objective

This project aims to predict housing prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Prepare and clean the data for analysis and model building.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and analyze the data to understand the factors affecting housing prices.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or improve existing ones to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune model parameters to optimize performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best model for making predictions.
